//- Annotations are a way of attaching metadata to code, and are not
// something specific to Kotlin. The annotations are read by the compiler
// and used to generate code or logic.
//- Annotations go right before the thing that is annotated, and most
// things can be annotatedâ€”classes, functions, methods, and even control
// structures. Some annotations can take arguments.
//- You can also create your own annotations, but this is mostly useful
// if you are writing a library that needs particular information about
// classes at runtime, that is [reflection](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/reflection.html#reflection).
//- Annotations are really powerful for creating libraries that inspect
// things both at runtime and sometimes at compile time. However, typical
// application code just uses annotations provided by frameworks.
