- Important: The suspend keyword doesn't specify the thread code runs on. Suspend functions may run on a background thread or the main thread.
- CoroutineScope and Dispatcher: In Kotlin, all coroutines run inside a CoroutineScope. A scope controls the lifetime of coroutines through its job. Scopes also allow you to specify a default dispatcher. A dispatcher controls which thread runs a coroutine.
- When creating a coroutine from a non-coroutine, start with launch.
    - That way, if they throw an uncaught exception it'll automatically be propagated to uncaught exception handlers (which by default crash the app). A coroutine started with async won't throw an exception to its caller until you call await. However, you can only call await from inside a coroutine, since it is a suspend function.
    - Once inside a coroutine, you can use launch or async to start child coroutines. Use launch for when you don't have a result to return, and async when you do.
- You do not need to use withContext to call main-safe suspending functions.
    - By convention, you should ensure that suspend functions written in your application are main-safe. That way it is safe to call them from any dispatcher, even Dispatchers.Main.
