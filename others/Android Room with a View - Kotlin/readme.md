- By default, to avoid poor UI performance, Room doesn't allow you to issue queries on the main thread. When Room queries return LiveData, the queries are automatically run asynchronously on a background thread.
- Usually, you only need one instance of a Room database for the whole app.
- Note: When you modify the database schema, you'll need to update the version number and define a migration strategy
    - For a sample, a destroy and re-create strategy can be sufficient. But, for a real app, you must implement a migration strategy. See [Understanding migrations with Room](https://medium.com/google-developers/understanding-migrations-with-room-f01e04b07929).
- Repositories are meant to mediate between different data sources. In this simple example, you only have one data source, so the Repository doesn't do much. See the [BasicSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/BasicSample) for a more complex implementation.
